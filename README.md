# Anki theme
## Anki theme for programming snippets

This is a template for all your Anki development decks, which was inspired by the excellent [Janki method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html). Works with both front-end and back-end programming languages such as `html`, `css`, `python`, `ruby`, `php`, `jquery`, `javascript` and whatever else you want to throw at it. Comes with inline and code block styling using the beautiful `Monokai` and `Tomorrow` themes I personally use in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).

## Card Types
There are currently two types of card, a simple card and a complex card. Both share the `themes/styles/main.css` file.

1. [Simple](themes/simple/README.md)
  - A basic question/answer card: e.g. What is the shortcut for `X`?
2. [Complex](themes/complex/README.md)
  - A more fully-rounded set of cards: an simple question, a symbol question and a puzzle question. Very flexible.


## Styling fields, inline code fields and code blocks

I've included some nice default styles for code; some fields will be automatically wrapped in `<code>` so all you need to do is add the symbol, class or function. The main `(code blocks)` need to be wrapped in a `<pre><code>`.

## Notes

I'm trying to keep updates from breaking existing cards, but unfortunately with Anki's structure this can be tricky. View commits for any major changes to the card's structure.
